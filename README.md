## WhackAMole

This is a basic WhackAMole game that has a green background and a blue square acting as the "mole". The game works by incrementing the score each time the user successfully taps the square which spawns at a random location on the screen every 2 seconds, I learned how to programmatically create UILabels, UIButtons, and how to write game logic with Swift UiKit, overall I gained more experience with the language.
